# UseAI - Transform Your Thinking with Visual AI Conversations

> **Why limit yourself to linear AI chats when you can create an entire universe of interconnected ideas?**

UseAI revolutionizes how you interact with AI in Obsidian. Instead of traditional chat interfaces, UseAI brings AI directly into **Obsidian Canvas** - where every thought becomes a node, every question branches into multiple explorations, and your entire thinking process becomes a living, visual mind map.

## 🌟 What Makes UseAI Different?

### 🎭 **"Marvel Multiverse" for AI Conversations**
- **Fork conversations** into parallel branches
- **Explore multiple directions** from a single idea  
- **Combine different thought streams**
- **Create knowledge networks** instead of linear Q&A lists

### 🧠 **Visual Thinking, Not Just Text**
- Each idea becomes an **independent node** you can move and connect
- **Spatial relationships** between nodes influence AI context
- **Colors and positioning** help organize and categorize thoughts
- **Zoom out** for big picture, **zoom in** for details

### ⚡ **AI Understands Spatial Context**
- AI doesn't just read text - it **understands Canvas structure**
- **Connected nodes** provide richer context
- **Relative positioning** influences AI responses
- **Conversation history** preserved through connections
